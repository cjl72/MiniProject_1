## GitFlow
GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It has attracted a lot of attention because it is very well suited to collaboration and scaling the development team.  As it can be seen in the image below, there are multiple different levels to gitFlow and how it operated with the master branch and develop branch being the main branches in the gitFlow workflow.  Following this type of workflow is beneficial on all levels for collaboration and keeping track of the contributors.
